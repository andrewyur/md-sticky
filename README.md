# md-sticky

a sticky note app inspired by the "stickies" app that comes with MacOS. I found it frustrating that it did not support md syntax, and had a ton of unecessary formatting options.

Created with Tauri & Sveltekit

Even though tauri apps are created with cross-platform capabilities, I am creating this app solely for myself and will not make any effort towards cross-platform compatibility.

## Features

- [x] Create new window through window menu
- [ ] Type in an md text editor
- [ ] Notes look like sticky notes
  - no window title
  - custom title bar with no minimize & full screen buttons
  - shaped like a sticky note
- [ ] Notes persist after closing/reopening the app
