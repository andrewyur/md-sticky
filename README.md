# md-sticky

a sticky note app inspired by the "stickies" app that comes with MacOS. I found it frustrating that it did not support md syntax, and had a ton of unecessary formatting options.

Created with Tauri & Sveltekit

Even though tauri apps are created with cross-platform capabilities, I am creating this app solely for myself and will not make any effort towards cross-platform compatibility.
